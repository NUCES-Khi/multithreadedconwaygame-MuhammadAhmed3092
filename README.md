For this assignment, I have implemented Conway's Game of Life algorithm in C language using a two-dimensional array to represent the grid of cells. The rules of the game were implemented using conditional statements. To run the algorithm concurrently, I created multiple POSIX threads to process different regions of the grid independently. I used mutexes and condition variables to synchronize access to the shared data structures such as the grid of cells.![WhatsApp Image 2023-05-14 at 00 18 24](https://github.com/NUCES-Khi/multithreadedconwaygame-MuhammadAhmed3092/assets/119106831/49ca6098-7cb0-46d4-a17d-6404faaf30d0)
